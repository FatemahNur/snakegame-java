# Snake-Game
This Java game, created with Swing, is completely functional.


## Description
All of the game mechanics from the original basic snake game are present in this replica. To improve the player-controlled snake's movement, a game called **loop/cycle** has been added. Additionally, the game **loop/cycle** lowers input latency.
